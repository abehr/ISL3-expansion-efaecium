# ISL3 expansion in _E. faecium_

This repository contains pipelines, scripts, and other custom code for our survey of IS elements in the ESKAPE pathogens, analysis of ISL3 expansion in gram-positive cocci, and description of ISL3-mediated pathogenic adaptation of _Enterococcus faecium_, as presented in [our paper](#Citation).

This work is currently under review; thus, it is subject to change.
